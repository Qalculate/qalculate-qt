    An empty translation file is required for the base language.
    If this file is not created, the base language will only be used as a fallback despite it
    being the preferred language of the user over other supported languages. E.g.
    $ LANGUAGE=en:nl qalculate-qt
    will result in Dutch translations being used despite English being higher priority.
